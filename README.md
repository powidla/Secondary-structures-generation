# Generative models for nonB-DNA structures generation
## Description

This repository contains code and data for the paper [Deep Generative models for generating DNA secondary structure sequences](https://github.com/powidla/Secondary-structures-generation).

Omics data for Z-DNA stored in [folder](https://github.com/powidla/Secondary-structures-generation/tree/main/data/DeepZ_data/hg19_features/sparse).

Experiments with deep learning models are stored in [notebooks](https://github.com/powidla/Secondary-structures-generation/tree/main/notebooks).

[Z-DNA BERT](https://github.com/mitiau/Z-DNABERT/blob/main/ZDNA-prediction.ipynb) predictions for synthetic data are stored at the [folder](https://github.com/powidla/Secondary-structures-generation/tree/main/zdna_bert).
