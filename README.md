# Generative models for nonB-DNA structures generation

This repository contains code and data for the article \href{https://github.com/powidla/Secondary-structures-generation}{"Z-Flipon Variants reveal the many roles of Z-DNA and Z-RNA in health and disease"}

The full genome predictions for human and mouse genomes can be downloaded here

To predict Z-DNA flipons on new data please use this colab notebook

The finetuned DNABERT weights can be downloaded from google drive:
