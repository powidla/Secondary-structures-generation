# Generative models for nonB-DNA structures generation

This repository contains code and data for the article [Deep Generative models for generating DNA secondary structure sequences](https://github.com/powidla/Secondary-structures-generation).

Omics data for Z-DNA stored in [folder]([https://github.com/powidla/Secondary-structures-generation](https://github.com/powidla/Secondary-structures-generation/tree/main/data/DeepZ_data/hg19_features/sparse)https://github.com/powidla/Secondary-structures-generation/tree/main/data/DeepZ_data/hg19_features/sparse).

Experiments with deep learning models are stored in [notebooks](https://github.com/powidla/Secondary-structures-generation/tree/main/notebooks).
